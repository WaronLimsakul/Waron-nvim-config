# Waron-nvim-config

Inspired by the Primeagen, I started explore neovim as a complete newbie. I found it fascinating and want people to
join my journey of learning this editor. Therefore, this repo is My Neovim config. I try to comment everything I learned in the file.

## Usage

- Use this repo as a reference for your own Neovim configuration.
- Read the comments to understand the functions of each file.
- If you are also new to nvim, [this video](https://youtu.be/w7i4amO_zaE?si=MM_3pJuTqFtYdAl1) concludes much of my configuration (Packer.nvim is unmaintained now, so I change to lazy.nvim instead)

## Contributing

Pull requests are not necessary. I just want to share my configuration and open for suggestions (it must be many flaws, feel free to suggest)
