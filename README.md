# Waron-nvim-config

Inspired by the Primeagen, my curiosity brought me neovim. I want people to
join my journey of learning this editor. This repo is My Neovim config.

## Usage

- Use this repo as a reference for your own Neovim configuration.
- Read the comments to understand the functions of each file.
- If you are also new to nvim, [this video][https://youtu.be/w7i4amO_zaE?si=MM_3pJuTqFtYdAl1] concludes much of my configuration (Packer.nvim is unmaintained now, so I change to lazy.nvim instead)

## Contributing

Pull requests are not necessary. I just want to share my configuration and open for suggestions (it must be many flaws, feel free to suggest)
